# ObjectDetectorApp
This Vue.js project allows users to upload an image and detect objects within it using the TensorFlow.js COCO-SSD model. Users can upload an image, and the app highlights detected objects with bounding boxes and labels. A progress bar is displayed during processing, and detected objects with confidence scores are listed below the image.
